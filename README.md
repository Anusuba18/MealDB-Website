Description:
In this project, I built a responsive meal search website using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, and TheMealDB API. The application allows users to search and explore meal details based on different criteria such as meal name, first letter, category, and area.
Initially, I analyzed the MealDB API using Postman by sending GET requests to different endpoints and verifying the JSON responses. After confirming the API behavior, I implemented the same API endpoints in JavaScript using the Fetch API to retrieve meal data dynamically.
The user interface includes a dropdown-based search filter that lets users choose the search type, a search input field with dynamic placeholder text that changes based on the selected filter, and a search button to trigger the search. The search bar was intentionally reduced in width and centered to improve UI balance.
Meals are displayed in a grid layout with four cards per row, where each card maintains the same size and shows a larger meal image along with meal details and ingredients. If more content exists, it is neatly arranged within the card without affecting the overall layout.
A custom theme was applied using soft and professional colors:
Background color: #EBEDDF
Text and accent color: #333A2F
The search button color was also customized to match the theme, and proper spacing was added between the dropdown, input field, and button to improve readability and user experience.
Overall, this project demonstrates API integration, dynamic filtering, responsive design, and clean UI styling, along with a clear understanding of how to test APIs using Postman and implement them in a frontend application.
